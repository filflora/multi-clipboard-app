# Multi Clipboard application with JavaFx

This application is a lightweight multi clipboard application written in JAVA 11 built with JavaFx.

It has only the most important features I needed:
 - Fuzzy logic search
 - Save up to 50 text based clipboard items
 - Clipboard history is stored in a JSON file next to the start file
 - Use the Shift + Alt + V shortcut to view history
 - Use Up and Down arrows to navigate between items
 - Hit Enter to copy item to the Clipboard, switch back to the active window and paste
 - No new Taskbar item is shown when running the app. It is available as a Tray icon
 
 
 To run it you'll need Java obviously. 
 
 On Windows just double-click the `dist/start.vbs` script.
